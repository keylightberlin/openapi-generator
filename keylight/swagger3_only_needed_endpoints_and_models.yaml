- name: Actions
  description: |
    Actions are operations that are batch in nature. For example, the "create", "update", "delete", and other operations allow changes to up-to 50 objects at a time. The "query" operation will return up-to 2000 result records back at a time, before requiring additional pages of data to be returned via a subsequent "queryMore" operation.

    The default WSDL version for Actions is 79. If you want to change the WSDL version, set the `X-Zuora-WSDL-Version` header. To find out in which WSDL version a particular object or field was introduced, see [Zuora SOAP API Version History](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/G_SOAP_API/Zuora_SOAP_API_Version_History).

    **Note**: Actions do not support the Invoice Settlement feature. This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. Actions also do not support the Orders feature.

    Some operations in this section are similar to each other, but are provided for different use scenarios. You should choose the one that best suits your needs.

    For example, the [Create account](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_Account) operation is used to create an account with a credit card payment method, a bill-to contact, and optionally an sold-to contact or an associated subscription. If you want to create an account without creating any associated objects such as subscriptions, use [CRUD: Create Account](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Object_POSTAccount) instead.

    If you want to create an account and the associated subscription at the same time without providing credit card information, use the [Subscribe](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Action_POSTsubscribe) action.
- name: Amendments
  description: |
    You can use amendments to modify subscriptions. However, Zuora recommends you to use [Update subscription](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/PUT_Subscription) (recommended) or [Amend](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Action_POSTamend) to do so.

- name: Custom Object Definitions
  description: |
    With Custom Objects service, you can define custom objects, extending the Zuora data model to accommodate your specific use cases.

    If you use Postman, you can import the custom object definitions endpoints as a collection into your Postman app and try out different requests to learn how the API works. Click the following button to get started:

    [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://www.getpostman.com/run-collection/1f068ba43651bf63c0d4)

    You can sign up for a free account on the [Postman website](https://identity.getpostman.com/signup) and download the app in case you do not use Postman yet.

    Note that the Custom Object Definitions API is versioned by `Zuora-Version` in the request header. The response may be different for the same request with a different API version. Specify `Zuora-Version` in the request header if you expect a specific response schema.

    ### Error handling      
    If the Custom Objects API call fails, an error code will be returned in the response body. See [Custom Objects API error code](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Central_Platform/Custom_Objects/Z_Custom_Objects_API#Custom_Objects_API_error_code) for details.
- name: Custom Object Records
  description: |
    With Custom Objects service, you can create, update, delete and find custom object records.


    If you use Postman, you can import the custom object records endpoints as a collection into your Postman app and try out different requests to learn how the API works. Click the following button to get started:

    [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://www.getpostman.com/run-collection/1f068ba43651bf63c0d4)

      summary: Preview order
      operationId: POST_PreviewOrder
      description: |
        **Note:** This operation is only available if you have the [Orders](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AA_Overview_of_Orders#Orders) feature enabled. Orders is now generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 284 (August 2020). If you are an existing Zuora Subscribe and Amend customer and want to adopt Orders, see [What is Orders Harmonization](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Orders_Harmonization/Orders_Harmonization#What_is_Orders_Harmonization.3F) and join the [Orders Harmonization community group](https://community.zuora.com/t5/Orders-Harmonization/gp-p/Orders-Harmonization) for more information. If you want to enable Orders, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com/).


        Retrieves the preview of the charge metrics and invoice items of a specified order. This operation is only an order preview and no order is created. 

        See [Preview a Subscription Creation Order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-guides/#Create-a-subscription-for-a-new-customer) for a use case of the "Preview order" operation.

        Zuora has the following limits on the Orders synchronous API to prevent performance degradation: 
        * Up to 50 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_Order) or [Preview order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrder) operation call.
        * Up to 50 order actions are allowed in a single [Create order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_Order) or [Preview order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrder) operation call.
        * Up to 50 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_Order) or [Preview order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrder) operation call.

        If you have an Order that exceeds any limits of the above, Zuora recommends you use the following asynchronous API operations:
        * [Create order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously)
        * [Preview order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously)

        Zuora has the following limits on the Orders asynchronous API operations to prevent performance degradation:
        * Up to 300 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call.
        * Up to 300 order actions are allowed in a single [Create order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call.
        * Up to 300 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call.

        If you have a need for a large order that exceeds any limits of the above, you can request a limit increase for the Orders asynchronous API by submitting a request at [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com).

      description: |
        **Note:** This operation is only available if you have the [Orders](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AA_Overview_of_Orders#Orders) feature enabled. Orders is now generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 284 (August 2020). If you are an existing Zuora Subscribe and Amend customer and want to adopt Orders, see [What is Orders Harmonization](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Orders_Harmonization/Orders_Harmonization#What_is_Orders_Harmonization.3F) and join the [Orders Harmonization community group](https://community.zuora.com/t5/Orders-Harmonization/gp-p/Orders-Harmonization) for more information. If you want to enable Orders, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com/).

        You can use this operation to create subscriptions and make changes to subscriptions by creating orders. The following tutorials demonstrate how to use this operation:

         * [Create a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/A_Create_a_Subscription)
         * [Add a Product to a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/A_Add_a_Product_to_a_Subscription)
         * [Create a Ramp Deal](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Ramps_and_Ramp_Metrics/B_Create_a_Ramp_Deal)
         * [Add a Product Mid-Interval Update on a Ramp Deal](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Ramps_and_Ramp_Metrics/E_Update_a_Product_in_a_Ramp_Deal)
         * [Add a Product in a Ramp Deal](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Ramps_and_Ramp_Metrics/C_Add_a_Product_in_a_Ramp_Deal)
         * [Change the Terms and Conditions of a Ramp Deal](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Ramps_and_Ramp_Metrics/D_Change_the_Terms_and_Conditions_of_a_Ramp_Deal_and_Update_the_Ramp)
         * [Change the Owner of a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Change_the_Owner_of_a_Subscription)
         * [Change the Terms and Conditions of a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Change_the_Terms_and_Conditions_of_a_Subscription)
         * [Renew a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Renew_a_Subscription)
         * [Renew a Subscription and Upgrade a Product](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Renew_a_Subscription_and_Upgrade_a_Product)
         * [Replace a Product in a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Replace_a_Product_in_a_Subscription)
         * [Update a Product in a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Update_a_Product_in_a_Subscription)
         * [Cancel a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/D_Cancel_a_Subscription)
         * [Remove a Product from a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/D_Remove_a_Product_from_a_Subscription)

        You can also see the [API Guides](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-guides/) for more use cases of the "Create order" operation.

        Creating a draft order is currently not supported. See [Known Limitations in Orders](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/C_Known_Limitations_in_Orders) for additional limitations.

        Zuora has the following limits on the Orders synchronous API to prevent performance degradation: 
        * Up to 50 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_Order) or [Preview order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrder) operation call.
        * Up to 50 order actions are allowed in a single [Create order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_Order) or [Preview order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrder) operation call.
        * Up to 50 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_Order) or [Preview order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrder) operation call.

        If you have an Order that exceeds any limits of the above, Zuora recommends you use the following asynchronous API operations:
        * [Create order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously)
        * [Preview order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously)

        Zuora has the following limits on the Orders asynchronous API operations to prevent performance degradation:
        * Up to 300 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call.
        * Up to 300 order actions are allowed in a single [Create order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call.
        * Up to 300 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously) or [Preview order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously) operation call.

        If you have a need for a large order that exceeds any limits of the above, you can request a limit increase for the Orders asynchronous API by submitting a request at [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com).        

        **Note:** When you are to suspend a subcription (via the `suspend` order action), if in the same "Create order" call you are to perform other subsequent order actions on the supscription to suspend, you must first resume the subscription (via a `resume` order action). 

        **Note:** When using this operation to create an account, create a subscription, run billing, and collect payment in a single call, if any error occurs during the call, such as a payment processing failure and a tax engine failure, then all the other steps will be rolled back. This means that the invoice will not be generated, the subscription will not be created, and the account will not be created.

        **Note:** This feature is only available if you have the [Order Metrics](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AA_Overview_of_Orders#Order_Metrics) feature enabled. As of Zuora Billing Release 284, Orders is generally available and the Order Metrics feature is no longer available as a standalone feature. If you are an existing Subscribe and Amend customer and want Order Metrics only, you must turn on [Orders Harmonization](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Orders_Harmonization/Orders_Harmonization). You can still keep the existing Subscribe and Amend API integrations to create and manage subscriptions.

          The segmented rate plan charges. When an amendment results in a change to a charge, Zuora creates a segmented rate plan charge. Use this field to track segment charges.

          Possible values are:

           * __last-segment__: (Default) The last rate plan charge on the subscription. The last rate plan charge is the last one in the order of time on the subscription rather than the most recent changed charge on the subscription.
           * __current-segment__: The segmented charge that is active on today’s date (effectiveStartDate <= today’s date < effectiveEndDate).
           
           * __all-segments__: All the segmented charges. The `chargeSegments` field is returned in the response. The `chargeSegments` field contains an array of the charge information for all the charge segments.

           * __specific-segment&as-of-date=date__: The segmented charge that is active on a date you specified (effectiveStartDate <= specific date < effectiveEndDate). The format of the date is yyyy-mm-dd.
